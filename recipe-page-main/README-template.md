## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This project helped me enhance my understanding of semantic HTML and responsive design. I practiced using Flexbox for layout and improved my styling techniques.

```html
<section class="ingredients">
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup of flour</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of sugar</li>
  </ul>
</section>
```
```css
.ingredients ul {
  list-style-type: square;
  margin-left: 20px;
}
```


### Continued development
In future projects, I want to focus more on accessibility and interactive design. Implementing ARIA roles and ensuring better keyboard navigation are key areas for improvement.

### Useful resources

MDN Web Docs - For understanding semantic HTML and CSS properties.

CSS Tricks - Great resource for learning Flexbox and Grid.
