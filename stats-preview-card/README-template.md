## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project allowed me to practice:

-   Implementing responsive layouts using media queries with a mobile-first approach.
-   Effectively utilizing Flexbox and Grid for layout control, specifically for aligning content within a card component.
-   Applying CSS pseudo-elements for visual effects, such as a color overlay on an image.
-   Refining my understanding of CSS specificity and how it impacts styling.
-   The importance of semantic HTML for accessibility and maintainability.

### Continued development

For future projects, I'd like to:

-   Explore more advanced CSS features, such as CSS variables for theming.
-   Focus on improving accessibility by implementing ARIA attributes.
-   Practice creating more complex layouts with CSS Grid.
