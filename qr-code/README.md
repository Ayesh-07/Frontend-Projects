## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Queries - For responsiveness


### What I learned

This project helped me enhance my understanding of semantic HTML and responsive design. I practiced using Flexbox for layout and improved my styling techniques.

```html
<div class="container">
<div class="card">
  <div class="QR-box">
<img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="">
  </div>
<p>Improve Your Front-end skills by building projects</p>
<p class="text">Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and  take your coding skills to the next level.</p>
</div>

  </div>
```


### Continued development
In future projects, I want to focus more on accessibility and interactive design. Implementing ARIA roles and ensuring better keyboard navigation are key areas for improvement.

### Useful resources

MDN Web Docs - For understanding semantic HTML and CSS properties.
